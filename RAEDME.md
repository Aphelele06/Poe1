# Cybersecurity Awareness Bot
## Project Overview
The Cybersecurity Awareness Bot is a WPF desktop chatbot developed in C# to educate users about cybersecurity and online safety. The application provides interactive conversations, cybersecurity education, memory features, sentiment detection, and a modern graphical user interface.
The bot is designed to promote cybersecurity awareness through meaningful discussions and practical online safety advice.
# Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to:
- Educate users about cybersecurity threats
- Demonstrate chatbot development using C#
- Implement artificial intelligence concepts
- Create a modern and interactive graphical user interface
- Use memory and conversation flow to improve interaction
- Encourage safer online behaviour
# Technologies Used
The project was developed using:
- C#
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- XAML
- .NET
- Visual Studio
# Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
## 1. MainWindow.xaml
This file contains the graphical user interface.
It defines:
- Window layout
- Background image
- Header
- Chat display area
- User input textbox
- Send button
- Button styling and hover effects
### GUI Features
- Cyber-themed interface
- Rounded panels
- Background image
- Professional styling
- Responsive layout
## 2. MainWindow.xaml.cs
This file controls user interaction and application behaviour.
Responsibilities include:
- Handling Send button clicks
- Processing Enter key input
- Displaying chatbot responses
- Showing typing effect
- Auto-scrolling chat
- Welcome message display
- ASCII bot display
- Exit command handling
### Typing Effect
The chatbot displays:
BOT: typing
before generating responses to simulate a real conversation.
## 3. BotMemory.cs
This file stores chatbot memory and recall data.
It allows the bot to remember:
- User name
- Favourite topic
- Last question
- Last topic discussed
### Memory Functions
The bot can answer:
- "What is my name?"
- "What do I like?"
- "What were we discussing?"
- "What was my last question?"
This improves conversation continuity.
## 4. CyberSecurityData.cs
This file acts as the chatbot knowledge base.
It uses a Dictionary containing cybersecurity keywords and multiple responses.
Topics include:
- Phishing
- Passwords
- Malware
- Ransomware
- VPN
- Antivirus
- Scams
- Social Engineering
- Identity Theft
- Wi-Fi Safety
- Two-Factor Authentication
### Dictionary Usage
Each keyword contains multiple responses.
Example:
```csharp
"phishing"
This allows:
- Keyword recognition
- Randomized responses
- More natural conversations
## 5. BotResponse.cs
This is the chatbot's main decision-making engine.
It processes:
- User input
- Memory
- Sentiment
- Keywords
- Conversation flow
### Features Implemented
## Name Capture
The chatbot asks for the user's name and remembers it.
Example:
User:
Hello
Bot:
Hello John!
## Keyword Recognition
The bot searches user input for cybersecurity keywords.
Example:
User:
Tell me about phishing
Bot:
Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information.
## Random Responses
Each cybersecurity topic contains multiple replies.
This prevents repetitive conversations.
Example:
Two phishing questions may produce different answers.
## Memory and Recall
The bot remembers user information.
Example:
User:
I like malware
Bot:
I will remember that.
Later:
User:
What do I like?
Bot:
You like malware.
## Sentiment Detection
The bot recognises emotional words.
Detected emotions:
- Happy
- Sad
- Stressed
- Worried
- Confused
- Tired
Example:
User:
I am stressed
Bot:
Stress can make challenges feel larger than they are.
This makes the chatbot more supportive and conversational.
## Conversation Flow
The chatbot asks follow-up questions.
Example:
User:
Tell me about phishing
Bot:
Phishing is
Have you ever received suspicious emails?
This creates interactive conversations.
## Fallback Responses
If input is unclear, the bot generates intelligent fallback replies.
Example:
- Can you explain further?
- Try asking about passwords or malware.
This prevents empty responses.
## 6. SoundManager.cs
This file manages the welcome sound.
Responsibilities:
- Play startup sound
- Handle sound errors
- Display fallback welcome message
### Sound Features
- Startup audio greeting
- Error handling using try-catch
If audio fails, the bot still launches successfully.
# ASCII Bot
The project includes an ASCII chatbot displayed at startup.
This improves presentation and user engagement.
# Background Image
The chatbot includes a cybersecurity background image.
Location:
Images/back.png
Image properties:
Build Action:
Resource
This provides a modern cyber appearance.
